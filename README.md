This project is a Streamlit application for quick visualisations of air quality data for a wide range of countries in a global level. The data come from the [OpenAQ API](https://api.openaq.org/docs#/).

This project was initialised based on the [Streamlit's Hacathon](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/connections-hackathon/47574) in order to extend and use the new built in [ExperimentalBaseConnection](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/connections/st.connections.experimentalbaseconnection).
